MyDataProject - Google Takeout


## Have you looked at your data today?

Anya Ernest's super creative project at Hyper Island led me to face the "fear" of my "browsing history".
Google makes available on this site takeout.google.com the option to download various data about location and history.
After cleaning the data, it is possible to have fun and analyze its virtual behavior over the years.
I discovered that I really like creating playlists on YouTube and I have 1 playlist for every moment (243 subscriptions/channel)!
After separating by time, years and analyzing my sample, it was possible to create some graphs and find the times when I look for more songs/videos, for example, motivation (around 7pm), love (11pm), and music religious - and the years I've done more.

Let's analyze your data?!
Enjoy!
